# bpls5-sdvx-r10-scenarios

This project visualizes **all possible qualification scenarios** for [BEMANI PRO LEAGUE Season 5 SOUND VOLTEX](https://p.eagate.573.jp/game/bpl/season5/) after the Regular Stage — **as of Game 10**.

It enumerates every remaining W/D/L combination across the final four matches and shows how each team could **qualify, enter a tiebreaker, or be eliminated** under each scenario.

Each cell represents **one unique W/D/L combination** of the remaining matches. Colors indicate the outcome for each team in that specific scenario.
